Part 1 - Variables
==============================

Data Types - string, boolean, number

String- A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
example- let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
	 let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes

Boolean- A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.
example- Boolean(10 > 9);
	 Output-True

Number- JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
example- let x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
         let y = 3;       // A number without decimals

Array- An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:
example- const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];


JS Object- A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.

JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.

JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.
